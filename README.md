## BIOL1440: Sustaining the Biosphere Final Project

This website was created for was created as my (Emanuel Louime) final project for the Boston College course, Sustaining the Biosphere. It is an interactive digital scrapbook meant to showcase my values, priorities, and personality at the time of creation. It consists of floating images which react to the cursor and collisions with eachother. Clicking on an image brings it into focus and reveals its caption. The website was designed and tested for desktop and primarily Google Chrome. It was built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). -- a full stack web development framework--- and written in typescript, html, and CSS-- three classics of web design. The site is being hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with a hobby developer account. The favicon in the toolbar is the Mountain Laurel, Connecticut's State flower and a meaningful reminder of the joy the outdoors give me, the outdoors role in my personal formation, and the transcendental and intimate approach I hope to take in considering the role I and my natural environment play.
